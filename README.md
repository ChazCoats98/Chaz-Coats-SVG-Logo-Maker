  ## Description
  The goal of this project was to make an SVG logo generator where the user can input certain logo characteristics and a custom SVG logo is generated from those inputs. 

  ## Installation
  Clone all required files from the github repository. Once files are cloned install inquirer and jest.

  ## Usage 
  Call the index.js file using node in the console. Answer all prompted questions about your desired logo design. Once all questions are answered a logo.svg file will be generated in the "examples" folder.
